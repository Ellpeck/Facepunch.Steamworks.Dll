# Facepunch.Steamworks.Dll
An extension for Facepunch.Steamworks and Steamworks.NET that ships with the Steam redistributables for every platform.

This [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Facepunch.Steamworks.Dll/) contains the native Steamworks DLLs from the official Steamworks SDK for Windows, Linux and Mac. It does **not** contain [Facepunch.Steamworks](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Facepunch.Steamworks/) or [Steamworks.NET](https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET), but is compatible with both, since neither of them ship the Steamworks SDK itself.

Note that the version of the package is the same as the version of the Steamworks SDK that it contains.
